**Image Compressor with Fingerprinting Feature**

***Description***

This project implements an image compression tool using Pythonâ€™s numerical libraries (e.g., NumPy and Matplotlib) along with a fingerprint embedding feature. The tool applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress images and can embed a "watermark" or fingerprint for verification purposes.

***Features***

Image Compression: Compresses images using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) while retaining a user-defined percentage of quality.
Fingerprinting: Embeds a random fingerprint into the image to serve as a watermark for verification.

***Installation***

To use this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- matplotlib
- numpy
